                <p>For me the easiest way to wrap my head around each of these, is by thinking of the tech stack as a house.
                </p>
                <p>The HTML is the frame. It's what holds everything together but the information it contains doesn't look
                    very pretty.</p>
                <p>The CSS is the coat of paint and the aesthetic section of the stack. It takes the information within the
                    HTML and styles it in such a way as to increase the user experience.</p>
                <p>Finally, Javascript. The plumbing and wiring of the house. It is the moving parts that actually allow a
                    webpage, or app, to function and perform tasks. Otherwise, we would be stuck with static information.
