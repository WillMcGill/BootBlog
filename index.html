                <p>For me the easiest way to wrap my head around each of these, is by thinking of the tech stack as a house.
                </p>
                <p>The HTML is the frame. It's what holds everything together but the information it contains doesn't look
                    very pretty.</p>
                <p>The CSS is the coat of paint and the aesthetic section of the stack. It takes the information within the
                    HTML and styles it in such a way as to increase the user experience.</p>
                <p>Finally, Javascript. The plumbing and wiring of the house. It is the moving parts that actually allow a
                    webpage, or app, to function and perform tasks. Otherwise, we would be stuck with static information.

                <p>As a User - If I have to spend more than a couple minutes searching a website for specific information.  I leave.  The shorter answer is the UI.  Is it intuitive and easy to use.  I'm probably using my phone and does the site resemble a usable app.</p>
            <p>As a developer - Same as above.  But making sure the information provided is correct.  Creating the site in a way that is scalable with constant change.  Can the client make easy changes? It would be important to use a framework that is widely accepted.  It does no good if the information is correct, but many users cannot access it in a digestible format.</p>

                <p>The importance of having a plan before you start to build your projects is one of my biggest takeaways from my Javascript projects.
                  Not only would I have been able to write better code, I probably could have shaved hours off the development process by simply spending
                  more time planning.  Preparing what you are going to code is just as important as coding itself.

                <p>This is a tough question to answer without having used one yet.  I expect it to be similar to the using the HTML framework Bootstrap.
                  There are many aspects of its use that allow for the shortening of the development process.  But I can see that the hinderance may come from wanting to do very project specific tasks.
